The answer is correct. The point (0, 3) in rectangular coordinates converts to (3, π/2) in polar coordinates, where r = 3 > 0 and θ = π/2 satisfies 0 ≤ π/2 < 2π. The Python output confirms this with r = 3.0 and θ ≈ 1.5708 radians (which is π/2).",1

The solution correctly derives that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p - q$, where $p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$. The Python output confirms this result numerically, showing that the sum equals $\frac{\pi^2}{6} - \zeta(3)$, which is indeed $p - q$ since $p = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and $q = \zeta(3)$.",1

All calculations are correct:
- f(-2) = 2
- f(-1) = 5/3  
- f(0) = 1
- Sum = 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 3 + 5/3 = 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3

The decimal equivalent 4.666... equals 14/3, confirming the answer is correct.",1

The LLM answer is correct. The prime factorization of 196 is 2² × 7², and using the divisor formula (2+1)(2+1) = 9, which matches the manually listed divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.",1

The solution correctly identifies that average speed is calculated as distance/time, reads the coordinates from the graph accurately, computes the average speeds for each student, and determines that Evelyn has the greatest average speed. The calculations and reasoning are sound.",1

The solution is correct. The reasoning properly establishes that each equilateral triangle has sides of 7 inches (21÷3), and since the regular hexagon is composed of six such triangles where each triangle's side length equals the hexagon's side length, the hexagon has 6 sides of 7 inches each, giving a perimeter of 42 inches.",1

The solution is correct. The smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is indeed 27, corresponding to the consecutive integers 8, 9, and 10. The mathematical reasoning properly identifies that we need $3n = k^3$, which requires $k$ to be divisible by 3, leading to the form $k = 3m$ and $k^3 = 27m^3$. For the smallest positive case, $m = 1$ gives $k = 3$ and $k^3 = 27$.",1

The solution correctly finds the direction vectors for both lines by setting the common ratios equal to a parameter t, then calculates the dot product of the direction vectors. Since the dot product equals zero, the lines are indeed perpendicular, giving an angle of 90° between them. The calculations and reasoning are sound.",1

The solution is correct. The distance calculation follows the distance formula properly:
- Points (2, -6) and (-4, 3)
- Distance = √[(-4-2)² + (3-(-6))²] = √[(-6)² + (9)²] = √[36 + 81] = √117
- Simplifying √117 = √(9×13) = 3√13

The final answer of 3√13 units is correct and in simplest radical form.",1

The LLM solution correctly identifies that there are 7 distinct values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses in the expression $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$. The values are 121, 126, 130, 140, 150, 160, and 180, which matches the expected answer of 7 distinct values.",1
