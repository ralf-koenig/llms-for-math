0,test/precalculus/807.json,"I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates (r, θ).

Given: x = 0, y = 3

To find r, I'll use the formula:
r = √(x² + y²)

r = √(0² + 3²)
r = √(0 + 9)
r = √9
r = 3

To find θ, I'll use the formula:
θ = arctan(y/x)

However, since x = 0, I need to be careful about the angle.

When x = 0 and y > 0, the point lies on the positive y-axis.

This corresponds to θ = π/2 radians.

Let me verify this makes sense:
- r = 3 > 0 ✓
- θ = π/2, and 0 ≤ π/2 < 2π ✓

Also checking: 
- x = r cos(θ) = 3 cos(π/2) = 3(0) = 0 ✓
- y = r sin(θ) = 3 sin(π/2) = 3(1) = 3 ✓

Therefore, the polar coordinates are $\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}$.","(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)","\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)","Match

Since 1.5707963267948966 ≈ π/2, this matches the ground truth answer (3, π/2).

For the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates:

Both representations are mathematically equivalent.",true,"Match

The answer is correct. The point (0, 3) in rectangular coordinates converts to (3, π/2) in polar coordinates, where r = 3 > 0 and θ = π/2 satisfies 0 ≤ π/2 < 2π. The Python output confirms this with r = 3.0 and θ ≈ 1.5708 radians (which is π/2)."
1,test/intermediate_algebra/1994.json,"I need to find a way to express $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ in terms of $p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$.

Let me denote $S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.

I'll use the substitution $n = j + k$ and consider the sum over all pairs $(j,k)$ with $j,k \geq 1$.

For a fixed value of $n$, the number of ways to write $n = j + k$ with $j,k \geq 1$ is $n-1$ (since we can have $j = 1,2,\ldots,n-1$ and $k = n-j$).

However, I need to be more careful about how to rewrite this double sum.

Let me approach this differently. I'll change the order of summation by grouping terms with the same value of $j+k$.

For each $n \geq 2$, I want to count the number of pairs $(j,k)$ with $j,k \geq 1$ such that $j+k = n$.

These pairs are: $(1,n-1), (2,n-2), \ldots, (n-1,1)$.

So there are exactly $n-1$ such pairs for each $n \geq 2$.

Therefore:
$$S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3}$$

Now I can split this:
$$S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}\right)$$

$$= \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$$

$$= \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{1^2}\right) - \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} - \frac{1}{1^3}\right)$$

$$= \left(p - 1\right) - \left(q - 1\right)$$

$$= p - 1 - q + 1$$

$$= p - q$$

Therefore, $\boxed{p - q}$.",-zeta(3) + pi**2/6,p - q,"Mismatch + explanation

The Python output `-zeta(3) + pi**2/6` simplifies to `-q + p` since `zeta(3) = q` and `pi**2/6 = p`, which equals `p - q`. However, the ground truth answer is `p - q`, so they are actually mathematically equivalent.

Let me reconsider the problem more carefully:

We want to evaluate $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.

By changing variables with $n = j + k$, we can rewrite this as:
$$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1 = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}\right)$$

This equals:
$$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q$$

So the correct answer is indeed $p - q$, which matches both the ground truth and the mathematically correct evaluation. The Python output was computed correctly but expressed in a different form.

Match",false,"Match

The solution correctly derives that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p - q$, where $p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$. The Python output confirms this result numerically, showing that the sum equals $\frac{\pi^2}{6} - \zeta(3)$, which is indeed $p - q$ since $p = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and $q = \zeta(3)$."

3,test/number_theory/572.json,"I need to find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196.

First, I'll find the prime factorization of 196.

Let me divide by small primes:
- 196 ÷ 2 = 98
- 98 ÷ 2 = 49
- 49 ÷ 7 = 7
- 7 ÷ 7 = 1

So 196 = 2² × 7²

To find the number of divisors, I use the formula: if n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ, then the number of positive divisors is (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(aₖ + 1).

For 196 = 2² × 7²:

5,test/prealgebra/1622.json,"Let me work through this step-by-step.

Given information:
- A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles
- The perimeter of one equilateral triangle is 21 inches

First, I'll find the side length of each equilateral triangle.

Since each triangle is equilateral, all three sides are equal.
If the perimeter of one triangle is 21 inches, then:
Side length of each triangle = 21 ÷ 3 = 7 inches

Now I need to understand how these triangles relate to the hexagon.

When a regular hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles, each triangle shares:
- One side with the center of the hexagon
- Two sides with the sides of the hexagon

Looking at the structure more carefully: Each equilateral triangle has:
- One vertex at the center of the hexagon
- Two vertices at adjacent vertices of the hexagon
- The side length of each triangle equals the side length of the hexagon

Therefore, each side of the regular hexagon is also 7 inches.

Since a regular hexagon has 6 equal sides:
Perimeter of hexagon = 6 × 7 = 42 inches

The perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.",42.0,42,"Match

The calculation is correct:
- Each equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 21 inches
- Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, each side = 21 ÷ 3 = 7 inches
- In a regular hexagon divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each side of the hexagon equals the side of one triangle
- Therefore, the hexagon has 6 sides, each 7 inches long
- Hexagon perimeter = 6 × 7 = 42 inches",true,"Match

The solution is correct. The reasoning properly establishes that each equilateral triangle has sides of 7 inches (21÷3), and since the regular hexagon is composed of six such triangles where each triangle's side length equals the hexagon's side length, the hexagon has 6 sides of 7 inches each, giving a perimeter of 42 inches."
6,test/number_theory/515.json,"I need to find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.

Let me denote three consecutive integers as $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.

Their sum is: $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$

So I'm looking for the smallest positive perfect cube that equals $3n$ for some integer $n$.

This means I need $3n = k^3$ for some positive integer $k$.

Therefore: $n = \frac{k^3}{3}$

For $n$ to be an integer, $k^3$ must be divisible by 3.

Since 3 is prime, $k^3$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $k$ is divisible by 3.

Let $k = 3m$ for some positive integer $m$.

Then $k^3 = (3m)^3 = 27m^3$

So $n = \frac{27m^3}{3} = 9m^3$

The three consecutive integers are: $9m^3 - 1$, $9m^3$, and $9m^3 + 1$

Their sum is: $(9m^3 - 1) + 9m^3 + (9m^3 + 1) = 27m^3 = (3m)^3$

Now I need the smallest positive perfect cube of this form.

For $m = 1$: $k = 3$, so $k^3 = 27$

Their sum is: $8 + 9 + 10 = 27 = 3^3$ ✓

Let me verify there's no smaller perfect cube:
- $1^3 = 1$: We need $3n = 1$, so $n = \frac{1}{3}$, which is not an integer.
- $2^3 = 8$: We need $3n = 8$, so $n = \frac{8}{3}$, which is not an integer.

Therefore, the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is $\boxed{27}$.",27,27,Match,true,"Match

The solution is correct. The smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is indeed 27, corresponding to the consecutive integers 8, 9, and 10. The mathematical reasoning properly identifies that we need $3n = k^3$, which requires $k$ to be divisible by 3, leading to the form $k = 3m$ and $k^3 = 27m^3$. For the smallest positive case, $m = 1$ gives $k = 3$ and $k^3 = 27$."
7,test/precalculus/927.json,"I need to find the angle between two lines defined by parametric equations.

First, let me find the direction vectors of both lines.

For the first line: $2x = 3y = -z$
Let $2x = 3y = -z = t$

Then:
- $x = \frac{t}{2}$
- $y = \frac{t}{3}$  
- $z = -t$

So the direction vector is $\vec{d_1} = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1\right)$

To get integer components, I can multiply by 6:
$\vec{d_1} = (3, 2, -6)$

For the second line: $6x = -y = -4z$
Let $6x = -y = -4z = t$

Then:
- $x = \frac{t}{6}$
- $y = -t$
- $z = -\frac{t}{4}$

So the direction vector is $\vec{d_2} = \left(\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\frac{1}{4}\right)$

Calculating the dot product:
$\vec{d_1} \cdot \vec{d_2} = (3)(2) + (2)(-12) + (-6)(-3) = 6 - 24 + 18 = 0$

The first line has direction vector from $2x = 3y = -z$, giving us direction vector $(1/2, 1/3, -1)$. The second line has direction vector from $6x = -y = -4z$, giving us direction vector $(1/6, -1, -1/4)$.

To find the angle between the lines, we compute the dot product of their direction vectors and use the formula $\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}}{|\vec{u}||\vec{v}|}$.

9,test/prealgebra/1139.json,"I need to find all possible values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses in the expression $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$.

Let me denote the expression as $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ and consider all possible ways to group the four multiplication operations.

The key insight is that I can insert parentheses in different positions to change the order of operations. Since there are 4 factors being multiplied, I need to consider all possible ways to parenthesize the product $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$, then add 1 at the end.

For the product $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$, I can parenthesize it in different ways:

1) $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)$
2) $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5$
3) $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5$
4) $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5)$
5) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))$

Let me calculate each case:

Case 1: $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120$
So the full expression is $120 + 1 = 121$

Case 2: $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = (6 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120$
So the full expression is $120 + 1 = 121$

Case 3: $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120$
So the full expression is $120 + 1 = 121$

Case 4: $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot (12 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120$
So the full expression is $120 + 1 = 121$

Case 5: $2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120$
So the full expression is $120 + 1 = 121$

Wait, let me reconsider the problem more carefully. The original expression is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$, which equals $120 + 1 = 121$.

But I'm allowed to insert parentheses anywhere, including around the entire expression or parts of it. Let me think about all possible interpretations:

Actually, I should consider that we have the sequence $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$, and we can insert parentheses to change how we evaluate it.

The possible parenthesizations are:
- $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1$
- $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1$  
- $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1$
- $2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1$
- $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1$
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ (original)

Let me recalculate more systematically:

$(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

$((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = (6 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

$(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

$2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot (12 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

$2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

But wait - I also need to consider if I can make different values by grouping differently, such as:
$(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1$ 
This would be $24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

Hmm, let me check if there are other interpretations. Actually, I should consider that I can also write:
$(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1)$

Wait, no - that's not allowed since we're just inserting parentheses, not changing the structure.

Actually, let me re-read the problem. I think I need to be more careful about what parentheses I can insert.

The expression is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$. I can insert parentheses to change the order of operations.

Let me list all valid parenthesizations of the four factors, then add 1:

The different ways to parenthesize $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$:
1) $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120$
2) $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = (6 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120$  
3) $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120$
4) $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot (12 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120$
5) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120$

All give the same value of 120 when multiplied by the four factors, so adding 1 gives 121.

But wait, let me reconsider if there are other ways to interpret this. What about:
$(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 + 1) \cdot 5$?

No, that would be changing the structure completely.

What about: $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1)$?

Let me think of all valid parenthesizations of the full expression:
$2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$

If I insert parentheses to group some of the multiplication with the addition:
$(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
$(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121$
$(2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$

Wait, I think I misunderstood the problem initially. Let me go back to the example given.

The example shows: $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot (5 + 1) = 144$

This suggests that I can indeed put parentheses around the entire expression or parts of it, but I must maintain the same numbers and operators.

Looking more carefully at all possible parenthesizations of $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$:

The possible distinct values are:
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
- $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
- $2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 121$

Actually, let me reconsider the example: $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot (5 + 1) = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 6 = 144$

This shows I can create a different structure entirely.

Going back to the original problem, I can create:
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$

But I could also have:
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126$
- $(2 \cdot 3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 7 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 140$
- $2 \cdot (3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 160$
- $(2 + 1) \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 180$

Wait, I'm misreading the problem. The expression is fixed as $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$.

Let me approach this more systematically. All possible parenthesizations of $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$:

Since we're dealing with $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$, and we can only insert parentheses in valid positions:

Actually, let me just compute all possible ways to group these operations while keeping the same elements.

The distinct values are:
1) $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
2) $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
3) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
4) $2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
5) $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
6) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
7) $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
8) $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
9) $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
10) $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$

But actually, I can also consider expressions like:
$(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126$

Or: $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 2 \cdot 61 = 122$

Wait, I'm misunderstanding what the question allows. The question asks for ways to insert parentheses into $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$.

The possible distinct values I can get are:
1) $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
2) $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
3) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
4) $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
5) $2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
6) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
7) $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
8) $((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
9) $(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
10) $2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
11) $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 126$
12) $(2 \cdot 3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 140$
13) $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 130$
14) $2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 150$
15) $(2 + 1) \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 180$
16) $2 \cdot (3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 160$
17) $(2 \cdot 3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 140$

But looking more carefully at what's really possible with parentheses in $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$, I realize there are only 5 distinct ways to parenthesize the first part (the multiplication), and then add 1. But there are other valid ways.

Actually, I need to enumerate ALL possibilities properly.

The correct approach is to see that we have the structure $a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d + e$ where $a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=1$.

But we can group any subset of the multiplications together with parentheses.

The distinct values are: 121, 126, 130, 140, 150, 160, 180.

Wait, let me be more systematic. 

The distinct values I can achieve are:
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$  
- $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121$
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
- $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121$
- $(2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126$
- $(2 \cdot 3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 7 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 140$
- $2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 5 = 130$
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 150$
- $(2 + 1) \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 180$
- $2 \cdot (3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 160$
- $(2 + 1) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 = 180$
- $(2 + 1) \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 = 180$

Distinct values: 121, 126, 130, 140, 150, 160, 180

That's 7 different values.

But wait, let me double-check: 121, 126, 130, 140, 150, 160, 180.

The answer is $\boxed{7}$.",4,4,Match,true,"Match

The LLM solution correctly identifies that there are 7 distinct values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses in the expression $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$. The values are 121, 126, 130, 140, 150, 160, and 180, which matches the expected answer of 7 distinct values."
