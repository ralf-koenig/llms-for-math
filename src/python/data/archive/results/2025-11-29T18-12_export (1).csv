1,test/intermediate_algebra/1994.json,"I need to find a way to express $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$ in terms of $p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$.

Let me denote $S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.

I'll use the substitution $n = j + k$ and consider the sum over all pairs $(j,k)$ with $j,k \geq 1$.

For a fixed value of $n$, the number of ways to write $n = j + k$ with $j,k \geq 1$ is $n-1$ (since we can have $j = 1,2,\ldots,n-1$ and $k = n-j$).

However, I need to be more careful about how to rewrite this double sum.

Let me approach this differently. I'll change the order of summation by grouping terms with the same value of $j+k$.

For each $n \geq 2$, I want to count the number of pairs $(j,k)$ with $j,k \geq 1$ such that $j+k = n$.

These pairs are: $(1,n-1), (2,n-2), \ldots, (n-1,1)$.

So there are exactly $n-1$ such pairs for each $n \geq 2$.

Therefore:
$$S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3}$$

Now I can split this:
$$S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}\right)$$

$$= \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$$

$$= \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{1^2}\right) - \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} - \frac{1}{1^3}\right)$$

$$= \left(p - 1\right) - \left(q - 1\right)$$

$$= p - 1 - q + 1$$

$$= p - q$$

Therefore, $\boxed{p - q}$.",-zeta(3) + pi**2/6,p - q,"Mismatch + explanation

The Python output `-zeta(3) + pi**2/6` simplifies to `-q + p` since `zeta(3) = q` and `pi**2/6 = p`, which equals `p - q`. However, the ground truth answer is `p - q`, so they are actually mathematically equivalent.

Let me reconsider the problem more carefully:

We want to evaluate $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}$.

By changing variables with $n = j + k$, we can rewrite this as:
$$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1 = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}\right)$$

This equals:
$$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q$$

So the correct answer is indeed $p - q$, which matches both the ground truth and the mathematically correct evaluation. The Python output was computed correctly but expressed in a different form.

Match",false,"Match

The solution correctly derives that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3} = p - q$, where $p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$. The Python output confirms this result numerically, showing that the sum equals $\frac{\pi^2}{6} - \zeta(3)$, which is indeed $p - q$ since $p = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and $q = \zeta(3)$."
2,test/algebra/2584.json,"I need to find the values of f(-2), f(-1), and f(0) for the function f(x) = (3x-2)/(x-2), then sum them.

Let me calculate each value:

For f(-2):
f(-2) = (3(-2)-2)/(-2-2) = (-6-2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2

For f(-1):
f(-1) = (3(-1)-2)/(-1-2) = (-3-2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3

For f(0):
f(0) = (3(0)-2)/(0-2) = (0-2)/(-2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1

Now I need to find f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0):
f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 3 + 5/3

To add these, I need a common denominator:
3 + 5/3 = 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3

Therefore, f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 14/3.",4.666666666666667,\frac{14}{3},"Let me evaluate f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) where f(x) = (3x-2)/(x-2).

First, I'll calculate each function value:

For f(-2):
f(-2) = (3(-2)-2)/(-2-2) = (-6-2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2

For f(-1):
f(-1) = (3(-1)-2)/(-1-2) = (-3-2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3

For f(0):

Now I'll add them up:
f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 3 + 5/3 = 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3

All calculations are correct:
- f(-2) = 2
- f(-1) = 5/3  
- f(0) = 1
- Sum = 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 3 + 5/3 = 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3

The decimal equivalent 4.666... equals 14/3, confirming the answer is correct."
