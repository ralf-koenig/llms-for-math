The given expression \(\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\) can be rewritten using a change of variables. Let \(n = j + k\), then for each fixed \(n\), \(j\) can take values from 1 to \(n-1\), and \(k = n - j\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

The first sum \(\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}\) is equal to \(p - 1\) because \(\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = p\) and the term for \(k = 1\) is \(\frac{1}{1^2} = 1\).

The second sum \(\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}\) is equal to \(q - 1\) because \(\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = q\) and the term for \(k = 1\) is \(\frac{1}{1^3} = 1\).

The expression consists of four numbers and three multiplication operations, followed by an addition. We can insert parentheses to change the order of multiplication, but the addition must always be performed last.

Let's consider the different ways to parenthesize the multiplication part \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\). The number of ways to fully parenthesize a product of four numbers is given by the Catalan number \(C_3 = 5\). These ways are:

3. \(2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5)\)
4. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
5. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)

Now, we evaluate each of these expressions and add 1 to each result:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\), so \(120 + 1 = 121\).
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\), so \(120 + 1 = 121\).

4. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\), so \(120 + 1 = 121\).
5. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\), so \(120 + 1 = 121\).

In all cases, the result is 121. However, we can also consider the possibility of adding 1 to one of the numbers before performing the multiplications. This gives us additional expressions:

\[
\frac{n}{n^2 - 1} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n+1)}
\]

which can be decomposed into partial fractions:

\[
\frac{n}{(n-1)(n+1)} = \frac{A}{n-1} + \frac{B}{n+1}
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator \((n-1)(n+1)\), we have:

\[
n = A(n+1) + B(n-1)

Expanding and simplifying gives:

\[
n = An + A + Bn - B = (A + B)n + (A - B)

Equating coefficients, we find:

For \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we have \( q(n) = 0 \). Since \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5 and has 6 roots, it must be the zero polynomial:

Now, we calculate \( p(8) \):

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 126:

\[
\frac{1}{14} = \frac{9}{126}, \quad \frac{1}{18} = \frac{7}{126}

Thus,

We know that if all roots are real, the discriminant of the polynomial must be non-negative. However, calculating the discriminant directly is complex, so we use another approach by considering the derivative:

For all roots to be real, \( f(x) \) must have a local maximum and a local minimum, which means \( f'(x) = 0 \) must have two distinct real roots. The discriminant of \( f'(x) \) is:

\[
\Delta = (2a)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot a = 4a^2 - 12a = 4a(a - 3)

For \( f'(x) \) to have two distinct real roots, we require \( \Delta > 0 \), which implies:

- \( f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 3 \cdot (-1)^2 + 3 \cdot (-1) + 1 = -1 + 3 - 3 + 1 = 0 \)

Thus, \( x = -1 \) is a root. We can factor the polynomial as:

The quadratic \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \) can be factored further:

21,test/intermediate_algebra/607.json,"To find the greatest integer less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\), we start by letting \( x = \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5} \). Then, we have:

\[
x^2 = (\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^2 = 7 + 5 + 2\sqrt{35} = 12 + 2\sqrt{35}
\]

We also consider \( y = \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5} \), and calculate:

\[
y^2 = (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})^2 = 7 + 5 - 2\sqrt{35} = 12 - 2\sqrt{35}
\]

Notice that:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = (12 + 2\sqrt{35}) - (12 - 2\sqrt{35}) = 4\sqrt{35}
\]

Since \( x \cdot y = (\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})(\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}) = 7 - 5 = 2 \), we have:

\[
y = \frac{2}{x}
\]

Now, we approximate \( x \) and \( y \). Since \( \sqrt{7} \approx 2.64575 \) and \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.23607 \), we have:

\[
x \approx 2.64575 + 2.23607 = 4.88182
\]

\[
y \approx 2.64575 - 2.23607 = 0.40968
\]

Thus, \( x \approx 4.88 \) and \( y \approx 0.41 \).

Next, we calculate \( x^6 \) using the binomial theorem:

\[
x^6 = (x^2)^3 = (12 + 2\sqrt{35})^3
\]

We approximate \( x^2 \approx 12 + 2 \times 5.916 = 12 + 11.832 = 23.832 \).

Now, we calculate \( x^6 \approx 23.832^3 \).

To find a more precise approximation, we use:

\[
x^2 \approx 24 \quad \text{and} \quad y^2 \approx 0
\]

Thus, \( x^6 \approx 24^3 = 13824 \).

Finally, we find the greatest integer less than \((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^6\):

Let's fix one of the 7 people, say Pierre, at a position. Now, we need to arrange the remaining 6 people around the table.

The condition that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other means that we need to arrange the 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) such that they are not adjacent. Since Pierre is fixed, we only need to arrange Rosa and Thomas among the remaining 6 positions.

First, we arrange the 4 other people (not Pierre, Rosa, or Thomas) in the 6 available positions. There are \(4!\) ways to arrange these 4 people.

Next, we need to place Rosa and Thomas in the remaining 2 positions such that they are not adjacent. To count this, we first count the total number of ways to place Rosa and Thomas in the 6 positions, and then subtract the cases where they are adjacent.

1. **Total ways to place Rosa and Thomas:** There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to choose 2 positions out of 6 for Rosa and Thomas, and \(2!\) ways to arrange Rosa and Thomas in these positions. Thus, there are \(\binom{6}{2} \times 2! = 15 \times 2 = 30\) ways.

2. **Ways where Rosa and Thomas are adjacent:** Consider Rosa and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super-person"". This block can be placed in 5 possible pairs of adjacent positions: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6). For each pair, there are \(2!\) ways to arrange Rosa and Thomas. Thus, there are \(5 \times 2 = 10\) ways where Rosa and Thomas are adjacent.

3. **Ways where Rosa and Thomas are not adjacent:** Subtract the adjacent cases from the total: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Finally, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 4 other people by the number of ways to place Rosa and Thomas such that they are not adjacent:

\[
4! \times 20 = 24 \times 20 = 480

The common ratio \(r\) can be found by dividing the second term by the first term:

\[
r = \frac{\frac{25}{3}}{\frac{125}{9}} = \frac{25}{3} \times \frac{9}{125} = \frac{25 \times 9}{3 \times 125} = \frac{225}{375} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now that we have the common ratio \(r = \frac{3}{5}\), we can use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric sequence:

\[
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}
\]

where \(a_1 = \frac{125}{9}\) and \(r = \frac{3}{5}\). We need to find the eighth term, \(a_8\):

\[
a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{7}

First, calculate \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{7}\):

\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{7} = \frac{3^7}{5^7} = \frac{2187}{78125}
\]

Now, substitute back to find \(a_8\):

\[
a_8 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \frac{2187}{78125}
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
a_8 = \frac{125 \times 2187}{9 \times 78125}
\]

Notice that \(125 = 5^3\) and \(78125 = 5^7\), so:

\[
\frac{125}{78125} = \frac{5^3}{5^7} = \frac{1}{5^4} = \frac{1}{625}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
a_8 = \frac{2187}{9 \times 625}

Calculate \(9 \times 625\):

\[
9 \times 625 = 5625
\]

So:

\[

2187 \div 27 = 81, \quad 5625 \div 27 = 208.3333

However, 5625 is not divisible by 27, so we need to check the simplification again. Instead, let's simplify directly:

\[

The Python output is an expression for the ratio of the magnitudes of the transformed vector and the original vector, given a vector \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). The expression is:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{4y^2 + (2x + 3y)^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
\]

To find the smallest positive real number \(C\) such that this ratio is always less than or equal to \(C\), we need to find the maximum value of this expression over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

The matrix given is:

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The norm of the matrix \(A\), which is the maximum singular value of \(A\), gives the smallest \(C\). The singular values of a matrix are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \(A^TA\).

First, compute \(A^TA\):

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
A^TA = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalues of \(A^TA\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^TA - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4-\lambda)(13-\lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16
\]

The roots of this quadratic are:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The singular values of \(A\) are \(\sqrt{16} = 4\) and \(\sqrt{1} = 1\).

The largest singular value, which is the norm of the matrix, is 4. Therefore, the smallest positive real number \(C\) is 4.

The ground truth is 4, which matches the correct calculation, but the Python output does not directly provide this value. The Python output is an intermediate step in the process of finding the maximum ratio, not the final answer.",false,"Match. The smallest positive real number \( C \) is indeed \(\sqrt{13}\). This is because the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) has a maximum singular value of \(\sqrt{13}\), which is the largest value of \(\frac{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\|}{\|\bold{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v}\). The Python output confirms this by evaluating the expression \(\sqrt{4y^2 + (2x + 3y)^2}/\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), which simplifies to \(\sqrt{13}\) when maximized."
63,test/intermediate_algebra/279.json,"To solve the problem, we need to factor the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then evaluate the sum of these polynomials at \(x = 1\).

First, let's substitute \(y = x^4\), transforming the polynomial into:
\[
y^2 + 3y - 4.
\]
We need to factor this quadratic polynomial. The roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\) are found using the quadratic formula:
\[
y = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{2}.
\]
This gives the roots \(y = 1\) and \(y = -4\). Therefore, the factorization of the quadratic is:
\[
y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y - 1)(y + 4).
\]
Substituting back \(y = x^4\), we have:
\[
x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4).
\]

Next, we factor each of these polynomials further over the integers.

1. **Factor \(x^4 - 1\):**
   \[
   x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1).
   \]
   Further factor \(x^2 - 1\):
   \[
   x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1).
   \]
   Thus, \(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\).

2. **Factor \(x^4 + 4\):**
   We use the identity:
   \[
   x^4 + 4 = (x^4 + 4x^2 + 4) - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).
   \]

Now, the complete factorization of the original polynomial is:
\[
x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).
\]

Each factor is irreducible over the integers. We now evaluate each factor at \(x = 1\):
\[
p_1(1) = (1 - 1) = 0,
\]
\[
p_2(1) = (1 + 1) = 2,
\]
\[
p_3(1) = (1^2 + 1) = 2,
\]
\[
p_4(1) = (1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2) = 5,
\]
\[
p_5(1) = (1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2) = 1.
\]

Adding these values gives:
\[
p_1(1) + p_2(1) + p_3(1) + p_4(1) + p_5(1) = 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10.

Setting the discriminant to zero for the equation to have exactly one real solution:

The correct value of \( c \) should be 34, as the circle's equation can be rewritten in the form \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 1\), which implies \( c = 34 \) to achieve a radius of 1.

The problem involves finding the measure of angle \( AFD \) in quadrilateral \( ABCD \) where angles \( \angle BAD \) and \( \angle CDA \) are trisected. Given that \( \angle BAD = 110^\circ \) and \( \angle CDA = 100^\circ \), each of these angles is divided into three equal parts. Therefore, each part of \( \angle BAD \) is \( \frac{110^\circ}{3} = 36.67^\circ \) and each part of \( \angle CDA \) is \( \frac{100^\circ}{3} = 33.33^\circ \). Since \( \angle AFD \) is the sum of one part from each trisected angle, \( \angle AFD = 36.67^\circ + 33.33^\circ = 70^\circ \)."

The Python output provides approximate numerical solutions, while the ground truth gives the exact solutions in terms of radicals.

To determine the final direction, we need to calculate the net angle of rotation after accounting for full 360-degree rotations. 

2250 degrees divided by 360 degrees per full rotation gives 6 full rotations with a remainder of 90 degrees. 

Since she spins to her right (clockwise), starting from north, a 90-degree clockwise turn will face her east. 

Therefore, the correct direction is east, matching the Python output, not west as in the raw LLM answer."
