Compiler Output: $(3,\frac{\pi}{2})$
Ground Truth: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)""

We need to compare the two. The compiler output is $(3,\frac{\pi}{2})$. The ground truth is \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right). They both represent the same tuple: (3, pi/2). However the difference is the parentheses: standard parentheses vs using \left( and \right). In LaTeX, \left( and \right) produce scaling parentheses that adjust to content. So the output is effectively the same but the LaTeX syntax differs. The problem: ""practically the same"". The question: Are they practically the same? Yes, the rendering is the same.

Thus the answer: ""Match"". Explanation: Both represent same tuple with identical numeric values; only difference is using standard parentheses vs \left(...\right) which yields same visual output.

Hence respond with ""Match"" then explanation line.

Check format: first word must be exactly ""Match"" or ""Mismatch"". Then next line explanation.

Thus answer: ""Match"" line then explanation. Should not include extra lines beyond these? The instruction: ""You are only allowed to response with either ""Match"" or ""Mismatch"" as the first Word. Also add an Explanation in the next line."" So we can output two lines: first line ""Match"", second line explanation. Probably no extra whitespace or lines.

Thus final answer:

Match
Both the compiler output $(3,\frac{\pi}{2})$ and the ground truth $\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$ represent the same ordered pair of 3 and $\frac{\pi}{2}$; they differ only in LaTeX parentheses syntax, which renders identically.

Let's output.

Match
Both the compiler output $(3,\frac{\pi}{2})$ and the ground truth $\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$ represent the same ordered pair $(3, \frac{\pi}{2})$; they differ only in the LaTeX parentheses syntax (\verb|(...)| versus \verb|\left(...\right)|), which render identically.",False,"import sympy as sp

Compiler Output: (3, pi/2)
Ground Truth: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)""

Thus, we need to determine if the two are practically the same. The compiler output is textual: ""(3, pi/2)"". The ground truth is LaTeX: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right). In a sense, they represent the same ordered pair (3, pi/2). The compiler output uses plain text: pi/2 while the ground truth uses LaTeX fraction. So they convey the same meaning: the point (3, π/2). So they are essentially the same. However, there is formatting difference: text vs LaTeX, but meaning is same. The prompt says ""practically the same"". That could be a ""Match"". Let's produce a response: first word ""Match"", then explanation.

We should be mindful that the output should be exactly ""Match"" or ""Mismatch"" as first word, then explanation in next line. No other content before. So response:

Match
Explanation: The compiler output ""(3, pi/2)"" and the ground truth ""\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)"" both represent the same ordered pair (3, π/2), differing only in formatting.

Yes. That's correct. Ensure no extra spaces or punctuation before ""Match"". Provide explanation after. Provide exactly ""Match"" then newline then explanation. Done.

That's all.

Match  
The compiler output ""(3, pi/2)"" and the ground‑truth LaTeX representation ""\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)"" denote the same ordered pair (3, π/2); they differ only in formatting (plain text vs LaTeX), not in meaning.",False,"import Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic

#eval (3, Real.pi / 2)","failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code","<think>We need to parse the prompt. The user says: ""Compare the Compiler Output with the Ground Truth. See if they are practically the same. You are only allowed to response with either ""Match"" or ""Mismatch"" as the first Word. Also add an Explanation in the next line.""

Given that we have ""Compiler Output: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code""
Ground Truth: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)

We need to decide whether the compiler output matches the ground truth. The ground truth seems to be a pair (3, π/2) presumably a pair of numbers. The compiler output is a description that the definition failed to compile, with a suggestion to mark as noncomputable. These are completely different. So we answer ""Mismatch"". Explanation: The compiler output indicates a compile error, not a numeric result. The ground truth expects a pair (3, π/2). So they are not the same.

We should respond exactly ""Mismatch"" as the first word (capitalized exactly). Then on the next line a brief explanation.

Thus final answer: ""Mismatch"", then explanation.

We must ensure no extra words before ""Mismatch"". Only ""Mismatch"" is first word; then newline and explanation.

We need to be careful: the question says ""as the first Word"". Usually they want exactly the first token, maybe ""Mismatch"" as the first token. They want ""Match"" or ""Mismatch"". Then explanation. We'll comply.

Thus answer:

Mismatch
The compiler output is an error message stating that the definition could not be compiled and suggests marking it as noncomputable, whereas the ground truth is a numeric pair (3, π/2). They are not the same.

That should be fine.
